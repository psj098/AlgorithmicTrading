This is a Python project for Quantopian algorithmic trading that trades stocks and ETFs based on a quarterly rebalancing schedule. The algorithm aims to achieve a market-neutral position by finding stocks that have gone public and trading them against an offsetting ETF in the same sector. The strategy was backtested and generated statistically significant excess returns(1.84%) at a 5% level, but returns decrease as the short-selling rate increases, and the backtested results should be interpreted with caution. The algorithm creates a market-neutral portfolio by taking long and short positions on newly public stocks and offsetting them with an ETF in the same sector, with a quarterly rebalancing schedule to stay up to date with recent IPOs and keep the portfolio market-neutral.
