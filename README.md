# Quantopian Algorithmic Trading

This is a Quantopian algorithmic trading project written in Python. The script defines a trading algorithm that trades stocks and ETFs based on a quarterly rebalancing schedule. The algorithm aims to find stocks that have gone public and trade them against an offsetting ETF to achieve a market-neutral position. The ETFs used in the algorithm are chosen based on their sector codes. The script starts by importing the necessary modules and defining variables such as rebalancing schedule and maximum position size.

The market- and cash-neutral long/short strategy of shorting an IPO-ed stock while longing an offsetting ETF was examined in a backtesting environment. The strategy relies on alpha capture to remove any correlation with the overall market so that the strategy can focus on relative mispricing between securities. The backtested results showed that, subject to conservative adjustments to dividends, commission, and delisting, the strategy generated statistically significant excess returns at the 5% level. However, it is important to note that returns decrease as the short-selling rate increases, and the reader should interpret the reported returns as a "maximum bound" for returns. At an annualized short-selling rate of 1.84%, the strategy will break even and excess returns will not be earned. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting the backtested results, and the strategy should be further tested and evaluated before being implemented in a real-world trading scenario.

Overall, the algorithm creates a market-neutral portfolio by taking long and short positions on newly public stocks and offsetting them with an ETF in the same sector. The quarterly rebalancing schedule ensures that the algorithm stays up to date with recent IPOs and keeps the portfolio market-neutral.
